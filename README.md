# E-commerce Seed Project

This repository is a seed-ready starter for a full-stack e-commerce application:
- Frontend: Next.js (React) skeleton
- Backend: Node.js + Express + Mongoose (MongoDB)
- Recommender: Python FastAPI microservice (optional)

## Highlights

- Premium storefront hero, filters, featured collections, testimonials, and newsletter built with responsive CSS (no UI framework required).
- Multi-page storefront (home, catalog, product detail, cart, checkout) with persistent cart, quick-add actions, and an order confirmation screen.
- Product API now supports search, category filtering, featured-only views, price range filters, tag matching, and multiple sort orders. Responses include pagination + price stats.
- Order API handles customer info, validates items against the catalog, and stores shipping totals + autogenerated order numbers.
- Seed script ships eight curated, design-forward sample products with rich metadata (highlights, tags, ratings, etc.).

### Frontend routes

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/` | Marketing hero, featured product, testimonials, newsletter |
| `/catalog` | Full product index with filters + sorting |
| `/products/[id]` | Product detail page with related items + quick add |
| `/cart` | Cart management (qty updates, removal, summary) |
| `/checkout` | Shipping form, order summary, confirmation |

What's included:
- Basic product API (list, create)
- Seed script to populate sample products
- Minimal frontend to display products (calls backend via Next.js API route)
- docker-compose file for local development (you must set MONGO_URI)

How to use (local):
1. Install MongoDB locally or create a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
2. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and set `MONGO_URI`.
3. Start backend:
   - cd backend
   - npm install
   - npm run seed   # seeds sample products
   - npm start
4. Start frontend:
   - cd frontend
   - npm install
   - npm run dev
5. (Optional) Start recommender:
   - cd recommender
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python recommender.py

### Product API parameters

`GET /api/products`

| Query       | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `q`         | Full text search across name/description/tags    |
| `category`  | Category slug (`audio`, `home`, etc.)            |
| `minPrice`  | Minimum price filter                             |
| `maxPrice`  | Maximum price filter                             |
| `sort`      | `newest`, `popular`, `rating_desc`, `price_asc`, `price_desc` |
| `featured`  | `true` to return only featured items             |
| `tags`      | Comma-separated tag list                         |
| `page`      | Page (default `1`)                               |
| `limit`     | Page size (default `12`, max `100`)              |

Response shape:

```json
{
  "products": [],
  "pagination": { "total": 0, "page": 1, "pages": 1, "limit": 12 },
  "stats": { "min": 0, "max": 0, "avgRating": 0 }
}
```

### Order API

`POST /api/orders`

```json
{
  "customer": {
    "firstName": "",
    "lastName": "",
    "email": "",
    "phone": "",
    "address": "",
    "city": "",
    "region": "",
    "postalCode": "",
    "country": "",
    "notes": ""
  },
  "items": [
    { "productId": "64...", "quantity": 2 }
  ]
}
```

Server recalculates pricing, adds flat-rate shipping, and returns the saved order:

```json
{
  "orderNumber": "ORD-123456-ABCD",
  "subtotal": 398,
  "shipping": 14,
  "total": 412,
  "items": [],
  "customer": {},
  "status": "processing",
  "paymentStatus": "pending"
}
```

Docker:
- Create a `.env` file with MONGO_URI and run `docker-compose up`.
