# Frontend (Next.js)

This is a minimal Next.js frontend skeleton. To run locally:

1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. Set environment variable NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL if you want to call a remote backend. Development assumes a proxy or that the backend runs at http://localhost:4000 and you use /api routes.
4. npm run dev
